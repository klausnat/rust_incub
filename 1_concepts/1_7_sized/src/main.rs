// TASK
// Given the User and UserRepository implementations from the previous task, write the actual code
// for CommandHandler<CreateUser> implementation described above.

// Provide tests for CommandHandler<CreateUser> implementation where dyn UserRepository is mocked
// with another hand-written type for testing purposes (you will need to transform the UserRepository type into a trait).

    // All implemented in lib.rs
